## EDA Visualizations
This section provides the descriptive baseline for the study: corpus scale, the yearly visibility of explicit feminine pronoun use in headlines, and sentiment composition over time. Cite in text as: see [Figure 2](#fig2), [Figure 3](#fig3), [Figure 4](#fig4), [Figure 5](#fig5).

![Count of Titles by Year](count%20of%20title.png)

*Figure 2. Annual count of titles (1911–1937). The corpus grows sharply in the early 1930s, which is useful context for interpreting year-to-year variation and weighting in later analysis.*

![Share of Titles Containing the Feminine Pronoun](share%20of%20title%20containing%20%E5%A5%B9.png)

*Figure 3. Yearly share of headlines that explicitly contain the feminine pronoun “她.” This is our headline-level visibility rate for explicit reference, showing when explicit mention became more common.*


![All Titles: Sentiment by Year (SnowNLP)](title%20with%20sentiment.png)

*Figure 4. Sentiment composition for the **full corpus** by year (SnowNLP: positive, neutral, negative). These unconditional patterns serve as the baseline that the fixed-effects regression revisits with controls for newspaper and year.*

![Explicit “她” Titles: Sentiment by Year (SnowNLP)](title%20with%20sentiment%20%E5%A5%B9.png)

*Figure 5. Sentiment composition for the **explicit-“她” subset** of headlines by year (SnowNLP). Comparing Figures 4 and 5 highlights whether explicit reference aligns with systematically different tone over time.*
